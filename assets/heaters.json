    "description": "HUUM DROP Electric Sauna Heater 6 kW is the standout model among HUUM heaters, largely thanks to its compact design. It is unique in the HUUM range as the only wall-mounted heater, saving considerable space in the sauna without compromising on the generous stone capacity that HUUM is known for. Inspired by the natural form of a water drop, its design introduces a rounded, softening element to the typically angular sauna space, infusing it with a touch of elegance.\n\nFunctionality-wise, the Drop excels. It can hold up to 60 kg of stones, outperforming many wood-burning and electric heaters in stone capacity, which is crucial for prolonged and consistent steam production. This large stone capacity allows for the emission of gentle, soothing heat. When water is added, it generates a rich steam, more abundant than what is produced by heaters with a higher metal content, which can often lead to a less comfortable, harsher heat.\n\nThe inclusion of a popular Wi-Fi control feature, enabling connection to the HUUM app for remote sauna activation, adds a layer of convenience, ensuring your sauna is ready for use the moment you arrive home. The combination of thoughtful design, superior functionality, and user convenience makes the Drop model, and HUUM heaters in general, highly regarded in the market.",

    "name": "HUUM HIVE Mini Electric Sauna Heater 10.5 kW",
    "model": "DROP-10.5",
    "power": 10.5,
    "description": "The HUUM HIVE Mini ranks as the second most popular model in the HUUM heater lineup, following the Drop. Unlike the Drop, which is wall-mounted, the HIVE Mini is a floor-standing heater, consistent with the design of other HUUM models except for the Drop. A standout feature of the HIVE Mini is its exceptional stone capacity, the largest across all HUUM models, which significantly enhances its heating performance and steam production capabilities. The “Mini” in its name distinguishes it from the larger HIVE models, which offer higher power options of 12 kW, 15 kW, and 18 kW. The HIVE Mini, on the other hand, is available in 6 kW, 9 kW, and 10.5 kW sizes. Customers often inquire about the differences between the HIVE Mini and the Drop, especially when the kW ratings are similar. The primary distinction lies in the stone capacity. The HIVE Mini can hold over 331 pounds (approximately 150 kg) of stones, providing a much greater thermal mass. This increased mass of stones not only retains heat for a longer duration, enhancing the sauna’s heat retention capabilities but also produces a more abundant steam when water is poured over the rocks. This substantial stone capacity means that the heat emitted is more evenly distributed and maintains a consistent temperature for extended periods. When water hits the heated stones, the large surface area covered by the stones generates a rich, dense steam, creating a more intense and enjoyable sauna experience. The superior stone capacity of the HIVE Mini makes it a preferred choice for those seeking longer sauna sessions and more robust steam production, distinguishing it from other models like the Drop, despite similar power ratings.",
